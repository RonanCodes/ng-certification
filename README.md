# angular-8t3kmd

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-8t3kmd)

## Note on the project update
This project has been updated to the latest packages in line with NG version 11.

These libs were not updated:
- "bootstrap"
- "core-js"
- "popper.js"

# Todo's
I've left TODO's in the project as extra enhancements that could be made.

# Routing
I'm using hash routing strategy for quick auto reload.
As the Push Strategy doesn't load the parameterised routes on refresh (like a server would).
